# M01W03 - TDD with Mocha & Chai

### To Do
- [x] Manual testing
- [x] Making assertions
- [x] Bringing in outside code
- [x] Exporting our code
- [x] Intro to NPM: a Node package manager
- [x] Mocha test runner
- [ ] Ignoring files/folders
- [x] Chai assertion library
- [x] What is TDD?
- [x] Practice unit testing

### Manual testing
- Confirm results of your code are as expected

### Assertions
- Forceful statement of a fact or belief
- In our case, we want it to throw an error 

- Node
    - C++ application running on our system (OS)
        - .cpp => compile into .exe => run it

    - HTML, CSS, JavaScript
    - Chrome: V8 Engine
        - JS interpreter
            - .js => run it
    - V8 Engine to the backend + OS functionalities
        - File system
        - Networking
        - Process
    => Node
    - Runs JS on the backend

### Test runners
- Mocha: a JS test runner that run tests! 
- NPM: Node Package Manager
    - Package: code that are bundled up into an easy-to-install format
- npmjs: the most popular package registry
- Use `npm install <pkg>` afterwards to install a package and
save it as a dependency in the package.json file.

### Mocha
- Interface: `describe` and `it`


### TDD
- Test-driven development: write tests first before writing code

### Unit testing
- Testing the smallest unit of your code (functions)
